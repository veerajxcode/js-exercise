# JS Exercise Repository

Welcome to my **JS Exercise** repository! ðŸš€

**NOTE:** I have past experience in working with **JavaScript** but that was limited, based on requirement. I wanted to learn **JavaScript** properly so that I can implement it in WordPress plugins and themes. And now you can also go through **[Choose Your Best Selling Products](https://github.com/veerajxcode/chooseyourbestsellingproducts)** plugin and **[NintyNine](https://github.com/veerajxcode/ninty-nine)** theme.

This repository showcases my journey of learning **JavaScript** from the basics to more advanced concepts. Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked on small projects to solidify my understanding and apply what Iâ€™ve learned. Itâ€™s a reflection of my commitment to honing my JavaScript skills, and youâ€™ll find practical examples of fundamental to intermediate-level projects here.

## What Youâ€™ll Find in This Repository

### ðŸ’¡ Key Projects
- **Color Changer**: A simple app to change the background color with button clicks.
- **BMI Calculator**: A project to calculate Body Mass Index based on user inputs for height and weight.
- **Digital Clock**: A real-time clock that displays the current time in a digital format.
- **Guess the Number**: A game where users guess a random number, and the app provides feedback on how close their guess is.
- **Keyboard Check**: A tool to detect and display the key pressed by the user.
  and more like **Scroll like NextJS**, **Your typer library**, **Mouse Circle** etc.

Each project helped me improve my understanding of JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, functions, loops, and more.

## ðŸ“š Learning Source

I followed the **[Chai aur Code YouTube channel (Hitesh Choudhary)](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode)** to learn and build these projects. The tutorials provided a structured and easy-to-understand approach to JavaScript, and I highly recommend them for anyone looking to start or advance their JavaScript journey.

## Why This Repository?

This repository demonstrates:
- **My growth from basic to advanced JavaScript** concepts.
- **Practical implementation** of JavaScript knowledge through real-world projects.
- **Problem-solving abilities** using JavaScript for a variety of tasks.
  
If youâ€™re a recruiter, this repository is a window into my coding skills, problem-solving mindset, and my ability to implement JavaScript in creative ways.
